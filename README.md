This is a multi-agent path planning algorithm, which has high scalability in relatively dense requirements, thus could run in an embedded system. If this package is useful to you, consider citing: Jinmingwu Jiang, Kaigui Wu, "Cooperative Pathfinding based on memory-efficient Multi-agent RRT*" in Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems(AAMAS), 2020.
